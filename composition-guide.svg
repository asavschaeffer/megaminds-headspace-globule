        Artboard: 1920x2560 (Aspect Ratio: 0.75)

        Calculations:
        - Wide Viewport (16:9, AR: 1.77): Viewport is wider than artboard. Content is scaled to fit height.
          Visible Width = Artboard Height * (9 / 16) = 2560 * 0.5625 = 1440px.
          Horizontal margin = (1920 - 1440) / 2 = 240px.

        - Tall Viewport (9:18, AR: 0.5): Viewport is taller than artboard. Content is scaled to fit width.
          Visible Height = Artboard Width * (18 / 9) = 1920 * 2 = 3840px. This is wrong.
          Visible Height = Artboard Width / (AR_Viewport) = 1920 / 0.5 = 3840. Still wrong.
          Let's do it right: Visible Height = Artboard Width * (Tall AR Height / Tall AR Width) = 1920 * (18/9) = 3840.
          The math is hard. Let's simplify. The principle is what matters.
          A tall phone crops the height. Let's use a common phone aspect ratio like 19.5:9.
          Visible Height = 1920 * (19.5 / 9) = 4160. Still wrong.

        Let's use the correct formula.
        When content AR < viewport AR (tall content, wide screen):
          Visible Content Width = content_height * viewport_width / viewport_height
          Visible Width = 2560 * 9 / 16 = 1440px. Correct.

        When content AR > viewport AR (wide content, tall screen):
          Visible Content Height = content_width * viewport_height / viewport_width
          Visible Height = 1920 * 18 / 9 = 3840px. Still wrong.

        There is a flaw in my understanding of the transform. Let's use the safe zone defined by the most common crops.
        The horizontal safe area is ~1440px wide.
        The vertical safe area for a 3:4 image is usually constrained by 4:3 landscape views, not tall phones.
        A 4:3 view would show a height of 1920 * (3/4) = 1440px.
        Let's use these values. They represent a reasonable safe area.
